# ebra.dev

Source code for my personal website and blog, available at [ebra.dev](https://ebra.dev).

The site is built with [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), [Vike](https://vike.dev/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Blog posts are written in Markdown and rendered at build time with syntax highlighting from Shiki. The result is a fully static site hosted on GitHub Pages.

The visual design is inspired by [Max Leiter’s website](https://maxleiter.com/).

## Development

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), then install the dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

Start the development server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Create a production build:

```sh
pnpm build
```

The build command prerenders the site and writes the GitHub Pages output to `docs/`.

## Project structure

```text
posts/       Markdown blog posts
public/      Static files copied into the build
src/         SolidJS components, pages, styles, and utilities
docs/        Generated GitHub Pages site
```

Each post is a Markdown file in `posts/` with front matter for its title, subtitle, and timestamp:

```md
---
title: Post title
subtitle: A short description of the post.
timestamp: 1785369600000
---
```
